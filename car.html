            ike almost every industry, automotive manufacturing took a beating early in 2020. Sales dropped as buyers scaled back their spending, and carmakers struggled to keep their assembly lines moving in the face of new safety requirements and supplier disruptions. As a result, a lot of highly anticipated new models have been delayed. But the industry has regained its mojo, and sales are up.

Besides, carmakers have a lot of development pipelines that aren’t easy to turn off. And consumer interest in new technology—particularly in performance cars and electric vehicles—keeps the global appetite strong. Daily commuting may have dropped dramatically in the spring, but people still need, and want, cars.
